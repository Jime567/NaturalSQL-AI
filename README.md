# Natural Language to SQL using ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo
[Web App](https://registry.jamesephelps.com)

The database lives on a MariaDB server and is controlled through SQL queries generated by ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo. The web ui gathers prompts from users and sends them to ChatGPT using the GoLang package [go-openai by sashabaranov](https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai). It provides the database schema as context for each user request. It then executes the generated sql queries and returns the sql server activity back to ChatGPT to generate a message for the user and attaches a copy of the sql activity for viewing. The web ui shows a live view of the data in the database tables.
